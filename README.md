# VerioT
The VerioT.py is the source code of our tool VerioT. The delegation operation templates are listed in the "templates" folder. In "Example" folder, we illustrate the delegation setting and verification result of a real-world IoT delegation (Figure 9 in our paper). More details and instructions will be uploaded/updated later.
